GAN-Based Cell and Slide Generation
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic cell images and medical slides. It is designed to augment datasets by generating high-quality artificial images based on a real dataset of medical slides. The GAN is trained on a dataset of labeled cell images with a 60:20:20 split for training, validation, and testing.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Loads, resizes, and processes cell images from a directory structure, ensuring all images are standardized to 64x64x3 dimensions.
GAN Architecture:
Generator: Generates realistic 64x64x3 cell images from random noise using a deep neural network.
Discriminator: Evaluates images, distinguishing between real and generated ones, using a convolutional network.
Training:
Binary Cross-Entropy loss functions for both generator and discriminator.
Alternating training between generator and discriminator to improve image generation over time.
60:20:20 Data Split:
Training: 60% of the images.
Validation: 20% of the images.
Test: 20% of the images.
Visualization: Displays generated images after each epoch for qualitative evaluation of the training process.

Train: Contains 60% of the images for training.
Validation: Contains 20% of the images for model validation.
Test: Contains 20% of the images for evaluating the model's performance.
Usage
Run the GAN model: To start training the GAN, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_gan.py
Adjust Hyperparameters: You can adjust the number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters in the script as needed:

python
Copy code
train_gan(epochs=10000, batch_size=64)
Training the Model
The training process alternates between training the discriminator and the generator. The discriminator tries to differentiate between real and fake images, while the generator improves over time to create more convincing fake images.

python
Copy code
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Generate random noise as input
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (batch_size, latent_dim))
    generated_images = generator.predict(noise)
    
    # Train the discriminator on real and fake images
    discriminator.train_on_batch(real_images, real_labels)
    discriminator.train_on_batch(generated_images, fake_labels)

    # Train the generator through the GAN model
    gan.train_on_batch(noise, real_labels)
Results
At the end of the training, you can visualize the generated images from the GAN. The quality of images improves as the GAN is trained for more epochs. Generated slides can be evaluated based on qualitative features or using quantitative metrics like GAN Inception Score.

Example of generated cell images after training:

Technologies
Keras: For building and training the GAN model.
TensorFlow: Backend engine for Keras.
NumPy: For data manipulation and random noise generation.
Matplotlib: To visualize generated images during training.
Future Improvements
Conditional GAN: Implement a conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate specific types of cells based on label input.
Improved Training Stability: Experiment with Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for better training stability.
Larger Dataset: Expand the dataset with more diverse cell images for better generalization.
Evaluation Metrics: Implement additional metrics like FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) to quantitatively measure image quality.
